FIXME

in addition to this repo you also need to clone test cases and needles:

$ mkdir distri
$ cd distri
$ git clone git@github.com:openSUSE-Team/os-autoinst-distri-opensuse.git opensuse
$ cd opensuse
$ git clone git@github.com:openSUSE-Team/os-autoinst-needles-opensuse.git needles

== use of git repo with with openQA

to use os-autoinst with openQA it needs to be "installed". Placing a
symlink to /usr/lib/os-autoinst that points to the git checkout
should work. To make tests and needles writable don't touch distri/
and use tools/fetchneedles instead to set it up.
