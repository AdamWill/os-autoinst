== Notes ==

- to test 64-bit guests, you need a 64-bit host kernel
- for hardware-accelleration (you really want that) you need a modern CPU. check with
grep --color=auto -e vmx -e svm /proc/cpuinfo 
- it is currently hard to test two isos at the same time, because the script does change dir to autoinst (writing all output to fixed files there) and because of the "killall kvm" used before&after a test. both can be amended in a future version.


== Debian/lenny setup ==

as root:
echo "deb    http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/  squeeze          main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/squeeze.list

cat >>/etc/apt/preferences <<EOF
Package: *
Pin: release o=Debian,a=testing
Pin-Priority: 40

aptitude update

aptitude install git-core kvm/testing ffmpeg2theora/testing gocr/testing
# kvm-0.12.3 needs older or newer bios.bin to avoid https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=603161 ; kvm-0.12.4 and kvm-0.11 work

echo kvm-intel >> /etc/modules


== openSUSE setup ==
http://software.opensuse.org/search?baseproject=openSUSE:11.2&q=kvm
http://software.opensuse.org/search?baseproject=openSUSE:11.2&q=gocr #>=0.48 recommended
http://packman.links2linux.de/package/ffmpeg2theora/166877
TODO


== more Linux setup ==
modprobe kvm-intel # or kvm-amd
chgrp kvm /dev/kvm ; chmod g+rw /dev/kvm # maybe redundant
useradd -m USERNAME -G kvm
passwd USERNAME # and/or add ~USERNAME/.ssh/authorized_keys


== user setup ==
git clone http://www3.zq1.de/bernhard/git/autoinst.git/ autoinst
cp -a env.sh.sample env.sh
edit env.sh # see comments there ; adjust or drop HTTPPROXY and SUSEMIRROR lines

for usage see README
