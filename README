about:
The OS-autoinst project aims at providing a means to run fully automated tests.
Especially to run tests of basic and low-level operating system components such
as bootloader, kernel, installer and upgrade, which can not easily and safely
be tested with other automated testing frameworks. However, it can just as well
be used to test firefox and openoffice operation on top of a newly installed
OS.


for setup see INSTALL

usage:
autoinst/tools/isotovideo PATHTO/openSUSE-KDE-LiveCD-i686-Build0625-Media.iso
by prepending RAIDLEVEL=10 (or 6) it will do a RAID setup (takes more time)
by prepending QEMUCPU=qemu64 you can force the Biarch DVD install type (defaults to 32 bit)

This will create all output files for a testrun in the current directory,
so make sure that you have at least 8GB of space there.

you can watch what it is doing by calling either
vncviewer localhost:99
