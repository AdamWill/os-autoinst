for setup see INSTALL

usage:
autoinst/tools/isotovideo PATHTO/openSUSE-KDE-LiveCD-i686-Build0625-Media.iso
by prepending RAIDLEVEL=10 (or 6) it will do a RAID setup (takes more time)
by prepending QEMUCPU=qemu64 you can force the Biarch DVD install type (defaults to 32 bit)

you can watch what it is doing by calling either
vncviewer localhost:99
or
tools/viewlastimg


to inject qemu commands for extra testing you can
echo sendkey ctrl-alt-f1 | netcat localhost 15223
